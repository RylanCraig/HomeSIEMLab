<h1>Azure Sentinel Home SIEM Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of an Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment for security event monitoring and analysis. By deploying a Kali Linux VM for attack simulation and configuring Elastic Agents for log collection, I gained hands-on experience in threat detection, network security monitoring, and incident response.
<br />

<h2>Key Features </h2>

- <b>Elastic Stack SIEM configuration:</b> Deployed and configured Elastic Stack for centralized log collection and security monitoring.
- <b>Security Event Simulation & Analysis:</b> Conducted Nmap scans from a Kali Linux VM to generate security events and analyzed logs using Elastic SIEM.
- <b>Custom SIEM Dashboard & Alerts:</b> Built a real-time dashboard to visualize security events and created custom alert rules for proactive threat detection.



<h2>Technology Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Box</b> 
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
- <b>Elastic Stack</b>
- <b>Nmap & Network Security Monitoring</b>
