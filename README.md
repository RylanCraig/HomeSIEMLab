<h1>Home SIEM Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of an Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment for security event monitoring and analysis. By deploying a Kali Linux VM for attack simulation and configuring Elastic Agents for log collection, I gained hands-on experience in threat detection, network security monitoring, and incident response.
